# NCMW - Groups and Computation (2023), KREA University 

The topics covered are roughly in three groups:

* Basics of Lean : Foundations, Definitions, Proofs, Programming.
* Word problem for free groups: Topology and Formalization
* Advanced topics: Inductive types, Computability, Graphs for group theory, etc.

## Basics of Lean

* Foundations (**Blackboard**)
  - Contexts, Expressions, Rules, Judgements.
  - Type theory: judgements, terms, types, universes.
  - Propositions as types.
* Introduction:
  - Use Lean as a calculator
  - Some terms and functions; functions applications.
  - Some types.
  - Look at some proofs.
* Recursive definitions in Lean:
  - Some definitions.
  - Partial definitions.
  - Termination proofs.
* Proofs in Lean
  - Declarative proofs
  - Tactics
  - Decision problems
  - Induction
* Programs with proofs: Smallest number in a list.

## Word problems

* Diophantine equations and a simple word problem.
* Free groups and topology

## Advanced topics

* Noncomputable functions and existence proofs.
* Inductive types.
* Cantor's diagonalization and rules for inductive types.
* Turing's diagonal argument and interpreters.
* Graphs and group theory.
