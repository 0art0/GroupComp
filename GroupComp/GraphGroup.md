# Fundamental Group, Covering spaces for Graphs

The first target is the Nielsen-Schreier theorem - every subgroup of a free group is free. Beyond the definition of the fundamental group, we need the following pieces (that are partly independent of each other):

* Fundamental group of a wedge of circles is the free group
* Spanning trees:
    - Definition of subgraphs.
    - Definition of trees: connected, nonempty, unique reduced path between vertices.
    - Adding an edge to a tree gives a tree.
    - Existence of maximal trees in connected, based graphs (containing the basepoint).
    - Maximal trees are spanning trees.
* Fundamental groups of connected, graphs with basepoint.
    - Find a spanning tree and consider pairs of edges that are not in the tree.
    - Claim that the fundamental group is the free group on the edges not in the tree.
    - For this, define maps in both directions: from paths to the free group and from words to paths.
    - Show that these maps are inverses of each other.
* Covering spaces:
    - Definition of covering spaces and maps.
    - Injections from the fundamental group of the covering space to the fundamental group of the base space.
    - Construction of the cover corresponding to a subgroup of the fundamental group of the base space.
    - Proof that the cover indeed corresponds to the subgroup.
